pouchdb-replicator
==================

A PouchDB plug-in that simulates CouchDB's replicator database daemon. A
browser version is available.

Version 2.0.0 onward uses prefixed replication fields (_replication_state
instead of replication_state). This requires a version of PouchDB in which
[issue 2442](https://github.com/pouchdb/pouchdb/issues/2442) is solved.
